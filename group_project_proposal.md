## Group Project Proposal: Open Data Application Design

For your group project, you have been asked by an imaginary client at Prince George's County to help solve a local information problem. Using the Open Data APIs available at [the Prince George's County Open Data API](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov), your group will be expected to **define** an information problem in the civic technology sphere, **consider** the stakeholders for the problem, and **design** a solution for your stakeholders using front-end web technologies that access and make use of public data API.

This project is intended to mimic the production of a contemporary dynamic web application. As such, it has two separate development sections: the front end, which will be used to display information and solve an information problem, and the back end, which will access a public API and supply local data requests.

While composing your project, you will be expected to make technical and people-oriented justifications for your use of technical tools, software libraries, and supporting systems. These are expected to appear in your presentation and documentation, as human communication about technology is key to being understood in the professional world.

### A Note On Group Work Grading
Although all group work is graded by group, the instructor for this course retains the ability to zero out a grade for any student whose contribution to the group work is seen to be low or minimal.

## Proposal
* Before completing your project proposal, you should complete and sign your Team Contract.
* This proposal is an exercise to get you thinking about the project before your mid-term presentations.

This project is intended to mimic the following steps of a professional web development system:

* Deciding on a data set to address
* Deciding what your application will be communicating with that data
* Designing a back-end API that will translate data from an external source to your application
* Designing a front-end web application to communicate with your server and display your information using an attractive and interesting method of data visualization

### Required Proposal Sections

#### Information Problem
* What is the information problem you're hoping to solve?
* Who are the people who care about this problem (the stakeholders - could be a group of people or a company or the general public)?
* How would your proposed system solve the information problem?
* Explain which API you've chosen to work with, and why (what's your information problem)?
* A description of the front-end technology you expect to use to make your application

* Choose an open API from [the Prince George's County Open Data API](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov) that will help you solve your information problem.
  * Possible options include, but are not limited to:
    * Urban Planning
    * Health
    * Environment
    * Finance

#### Presentation Proposal
* Consider how you will present your information problem and your proposed solution to your peers in a persuasive and convincing fashion.

#### Technology Stack
While you will be provided with some sample Node.JS code for the back end, you will be asked to make some sensible front-end decisions.
  
* HTML/CSS? React? Pure Javascript? SCSS?
* What technologies will you be using to author your front end?
* What devices are you targeting as part of your project?  

#### Initial Wireframes
You are required to have considered the following elements
* Your index page or general app access - what will it look like?
* An About page that defines the project and tells people what to expect, and a little bit about your information problem
* A documentation page that covers how to use your application to best effect
