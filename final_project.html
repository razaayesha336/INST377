<p>Through the group project in the INST 377 class, students are expected to design and build a web application that
  runs on a real server (VCL, AWS, etc). Particularly, technology, design AND management in the group project need to be
  justified well in your presentations and documentations, since communicating technology with both developers and
  non-technical people is a very important qualification in the real-world as well as in academia. Evaluation criteria
  and directions are presented below.</p>

<h2 id="finalreports">Final Reports</h2>

<p>Each team is expected to submit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>User Manual (docs/user.md)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This document should be used to explain the application and its use to your identified stakeholders.</li>

      <li>It explains how they should use the system.</li>

      <li>It should be written in clear, plain, non-technical language.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>README (top part of your README.md)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Title of your project</li>

      <li>Description of your project</li>

      <li>Link to the Heroku, Netlify, or Digital Ocean instance where your application can be used</li>

      <li>Description of target browsers (iOS? Android? Which ones?)</li>

      <li>Link to User Manual </li>

      <li>Link to Developer Manual</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Developer Manual (bottom half of your README.md)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.</li>

      <li>They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about
        your system design.</li>

      <li>You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on
        their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.</li>

      <li>Your Developer Manual covers:


        <ul>
          <li>How to install your application and all dependencies</li>

          <li>How to run your application on a server</li>

          <li>How to run any tests you have written for your software</li>

          <li>The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PATCH, etc endpoints, and what they each do</li>

          <li>A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Final Report (docs/final.md)
      This rest of the document is a brief description of your final presentation.</p>
